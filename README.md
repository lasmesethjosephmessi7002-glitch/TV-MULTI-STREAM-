📺 TV Multi-Stream

🚀 Overview

TV Multi-Stream is an interactive web demo that simulates a television capable of broadcasting multiple programs simultaneously on a single channel.
Each stream keeps running in the background, so when a user switches between programs, they resume in real time, not from the beginning, just like on a real TV network.

This project is part of Lasme Seth Joseph Messi Emmanuel’s innovation portfolio for MIT.




🎯 Features

🔹 Watch multiple video streams on a single page.

🔹 Each stream continues playing even when you switch away.

🔹 Instant switching between programs : no restart, no buffering.

🔹 Clean, responsive UI for desktop and mobile.

🔹 Lightweight: built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.





🧠 Concept

The idea behind TV Multi-Stream is to rethink how content can be broadcast on a single frequency or channel, allowing simultaneous programs and user-controlled switching.
This technology could inspire interactive television systems and multi-content streaming platforms of the future.
